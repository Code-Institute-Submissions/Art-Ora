# Art/-Ora Milestone Project 1

 

## Layout

The layout of the website is distinguishably minimalistic and reasonably straightforward to navigate. Each one of the three pages that make up the entirety of the website has a very similar layout to the each other. Except for the definite changes in colour, icons and information.


## Theme

The theme/ colour of each element and webpage was deliberately picked to create a sense of engagement and clarity for the user, with the intent for them to be able to identify their exact location within the website. 
The colour pallet was also deliberately chosen with the primary focus on creating a sense of familiarity similar to bigger and more trusted brand like **Google**, but with more 'Pastel' values.

## Purpose

The purpose of designing this project was to allow me to put all the newly accumulated information that I learnt throughout the **"User-Centric Frontend Development"** module into practice, with the main focus on designing a great user experience.

## Special Thanks

A special thanks to [**Code Institute**](https://codeinstitute.net/), whom without their immensely helpful and insightful video tutorials and educational material, I would not be able to create projects like this.
